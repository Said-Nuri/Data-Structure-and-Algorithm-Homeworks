1. Problem definition:

We will write a Java Interface (named GITList<E>) that defines given methods.

We will write two classes (GITLinkedList and GITArrayList) that implements GITList<E> interface. 

GITLinkedList will use the class KWLinkedList of the textbook by composition and will delegate all operations to this object as much as possible. 

Similarly, GITArrayList will use the class KWArrayList of the textbook by composition and will delegate all operations to this object as much as possible.

	
	
2. Problem analysis and design:

	We have two classes to implement GITList<E> interface. These two classes must contain an instance of given KWLinkedList and KWArrayList separately. That is about delegation.
